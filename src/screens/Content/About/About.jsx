          <br />
          <p className='about-callout strong'>I‚Äôm Ale, Product Designer with 8+ years of experience solving complex problems through simple, clear, and user-centered solutions that <b>help startups optimize UX and scale</b>. </p>
          <br />
          <p>I thrive in cross-functional environments, <b>facilitating collaboration</b> to bring out the best in teams and create impactful products.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I enjoy building quick, realistic prototypes to <b>test ideas cost-effectively </b>and breaking down challenges‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs <b>developing digital products</b>, <b>streamlining operations</b>, or <b>designing scalable systems.</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>In an era where people are increasingly hooked on their devices, I'm a big fan of ‚Äúdesign for disengagement‚Äù‚Äîwhere things work mostly automatically and effortlessly, just like magic, so people can focus on what truly matters.</p>

          <p className='section-title'>My journey</p>
          <br />
          <p>I‚Äôve always been a creative person, but I‚Äôve also had a love for the logic of math and the thrill of solving problems.</p>
          <br />
          <p>As a kid, I loved watching a craft show for children with my mom called Art Attack. I was obsessed with making things, especially when it involved the show‚Äôs famous ‚ÄúArt Attack mixture‚Äù ‚Äì a gooey blend of white glue, water, and newspaper or paper towels. In my free time, I‚Äôd often draw in a comic or manga style, letting my imagination run wild.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Nowadays I really enjoy taking pictures with my Fujifilm camera (Astrophotography and Street photography)</p>
          <br />
          <p>Math was always one of my strengths, and for a long time, I dreamed of becoming an architect. I had a knack for technical drawing and spatial reasoning. But life had other plans ‚Äì I ended up enrolling in an arts-focused high school and later pursued a degree in Graphic Design.</p>
          <br />
          <p>During my studies, I took a programming course where I learned the basics of <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b>. It was a revelation. I loved coding so much that I landed an internship as a front-end developer for a digital fashion magazine for iPads, where my teammate and I dabbled in JavaScript (while I was still studying).</p>
          <br />
          <p>Thanks to programming, I discovered web design, which led to my first job as a web designer at a well-known printing company in Madrid. I worked on proposals for national museums, banks, and other big clients. Looking back, I can‚Äôt believe we designed everything in Adobe Photoshop. It‚Äôs funny ‚Äì and a little horrifying ‚Äì to think about now!</p>
          <br />

          <p className='section-title'>Why UX Design?</p>
          <br />
          <p>My second job was the turning point. I joined a startup as a Visual Designer, working across both Marketing and Product. It was there that Carlos, the Lead Product Designer, introduced me to the world of UX design.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I‚Äôll never forget the first time I showed him a small mobile flow I‚Äôd designed. I thought it was awesome and super intuitive. His response? ‚ÄúMake a prototype and test it with five users.‚Äù</p>
          <br />
          <p>So, I rolled up my sleeves, whipped up a prototype using Sketch and Adobe XD, and tested it with five people. To my surprise, parts of the flow didn‚Äôt make sense to them at all. Instead of being discouraged, I was hooked. When I told Carlos what I‚Äôd learned, he said, ‚ÄúNow fix what doesn‚Äôt work and test it again.‚Äù</p>
          <br />
          <p>That day, I decided I wanted to be a Digital Product Designer.</p>
